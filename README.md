# Potato Disease Classifier

This project is a simple web application built with **FastAPI** that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify potato diseases. The application can identify the following conditions:  
- Early Blight  
- Late Blight  
- Healthy  

The model is designed to assist farmers and agricultural experts in diagnosing potato diseases quickly and accurately.
